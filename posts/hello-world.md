# About Me  
Hi, I’m Mahdi, a master’s student in Computer Science.

During my academic journey, I’ve noticed that university often focuses on exams and predefined projects, leaving limited opportunities for independent exploration. It’s easy to get caught up in the routine of assignments and deadlines, leaving little room for creating and experimenting freely.

# Why This Blog?  
By writing here, I’m challenging myself to regularly engage with new ideas and projects. I aim to break down concepts into simpler terms as I learn. This not only deepens my understanding but also allows me to share practical insights that others might find useful. I hope you enjoy and benefit from what I share.

# What’s Next?  
I plan to post regularly about interesting concepts I encounter, exciting projects I’m working on along with the challenges I encounter along the way. If you’re interested in collaborating on a project or have ideas to share, feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect!
